> ðŸ¦€ A Rust rewrite is available to try at [`npm install -g synopkg@alpha`](https://github.com/SynoPkg/synopkg/releases?q=14.0.0)

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev synopkg
```

## Commands

### [fix-mismatches](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/fix-mismatches)

Ensure that multiple packages requiring the same dependency define the same version, so that every package requires eg. `react@16.4.2`, instead of a combination of `react@16.4.2`, `react@0.15.9`, and `react@16.0.0`.

### [format](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/format)

Organise package.json files according to a conventional format, where fields appear in a predictable order and nested fields are ordered alphabetically. Shorthand properties are used where available, such as the `"repository"` and `"bugs"` fields.

### [lint](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/lint)

Lint all versions and ranges and exit with 0 or 1 based on whether all files match your Synopkg configuration file.

### [lint-semver-ranges](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/lint-semver-ranges)

Check whether dependency versions used within "dependencies", "devDependencies", etc follow a consistent format.

### [list](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/list)

List all dependencies required by your packages.

### [list-mismatches](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/list-mismatches)

List dependencies which are required by multiple packages, where the version is not the same across every package.

### [prompt](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/prompt)

Displays a series of prompts to fix mismatches which synopkg cannot fix automatically.

### [set-semver-ranges](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/set-semver-ranges)

Ensure dependency versions used within `"dependencies"`, `"devDependencies"` etc follow a consistent format.

### [update](https://synopkg.github.io/synopkg/command/update)

Interactively update packages to the latest versions from the npm registry, wherever they are in your monorepo. You can update every dependency, just dev/peer/prod dependencies, just packages which match a name filter, and more.
